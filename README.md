nlp-exercises
=============

This repository contains my answers to exercises from *Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit* (Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper, O'Reilly Media 2009).

The book is available online here: http://nltk.org/book/. It's a fascinating text with plenty of neat examples.
